# Description
In the game, a player will select a topic and at least 8 chemistry images in that topic (they can also be chosen randomly from the database). After submitting all images, the game playground will be ready to play. The timer will start once the player flips the second card. The number of moves and matched pairs will also be recorded and stored into the database once the game finishes. Matched pairs are displayed on the right column. When the game finishes, a congrats modal will show the total time elapsed, the number of moves and the number of matched pairs.

3. Select at least 8 elements by checking check boxes and click on the “Submit” button or “Select All” button to let the computer pick randomly, or “Back” button if you wish to change the topic.
